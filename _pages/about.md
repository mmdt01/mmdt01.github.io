Driven by a curiosity about intelligence, both natural and artificial, I am a Robotics and AI enthusiast with a background in Integrated Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. My 9 months of industry experience as a Machine Learning engineer ignited a passion to leverage these fields for real-world good. Currently, I'm delving into the fascinating world of brain-computer interfaces at the [University of Bath's Centre for Bioengineering and Biomedical technologies](https://www.bath.ac.uk/research-centres/centre-for-bioengineering-biomedical-technologies/), exploring how novel Deep Learning methods can be used to decode neural signals of imagined interactions with robotic manipulators.

Beyond the lab, I'm a South African native who draws energy from the outdoors. A passionate climber, surfer and wildlife enthusiast, I believe in a balanced life that fuels both my scientific curiosity and my connection to the world around me. My ultimate goal? To combine my problem-solving skills with my fascination for intelligent systems to create general-purpose learning algorithms that have a truly positive impact on people's lives.



<!-- Hi there, I am writing a summary paragraph about myself for my personal webpage. I would like the summary to express my enthusiasm for robotics and AI, and how the two fields can be used to make a tremendous positive impact on improving the qualities of people's lives. -->




Research interests
------

My interests lie at the intersection of human physiology and engineering, particularly in the context of recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence. These advancements have opened exciting avenues for developing transformative technologies in rehabilitation engineering, human-robot interaction (HRI), and biomedical robotics. These fields hold significant potential to not only restore lost functionalities but also augment human capabilities. Within this domain, I am particularly drawn to neuroengineering, a field with vast unexplored territory. The potential for groundbreaking advancements through brain-computer interfaces is a powerful motivator in my research pursuits.
