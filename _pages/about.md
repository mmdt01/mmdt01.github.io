Driven by a curiosity about intelligence, both natural and artificial, I am a Robotics and AI enthusiast with a background in Integrated Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. My 9 months of industry experience as a Machine Learning engineer ignited a passion to leverage these fields for real-world good. Currently, I'm delving into the fascinating world of brain-computer interfaces at the [University of Bath's Centre for Bioengineering and Biomedical technologies](https://www.bath.ac.uk/research-centres/centre-for-bioengineering-biomedical-technologies/), exploring how novel Deep Learning methods can be used to decode neural signals of imagined interactions with robotic manipulators.

Beyond the lab, I'm a South African native who draws energy from the outdoors. A passionate surfer, climber, and wildlife enthusiast, I believe in a balanced life that fuels both my scientific curiosity and my connection to the world around me. My ultimate goal? To combine my problem-solving skills with my fascination for intelligent systems to create general-purpose learning algorithms that have a truly positive impact on people's lives.



<!-- Hi there, I am writing a summary paragraph about myself for my personal webpage. I would like the summary to express my enthusiasm for robotics and AI, and how the two fields can be used to make a tremendous positive impact on improving the qualities of people's lives. -->

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
